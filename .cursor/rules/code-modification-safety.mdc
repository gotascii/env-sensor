# Code Modification Safety Rule

This rule ensures that modifications to existing code files require explicit confirmation before any changes are proposed.

      Direct code modifications are not allowed.
      
      Please follow this strict process:
      1. Format your proposal using this template:
      
      [PROPOSAL]
      Changes to be made:
      1. File: <filename>
         - Specific change details
      2. File: <filename>
         - Specific change details
      
      Reason for changes: <explanation>
      
      Do you approve these changes?
      
      2. Wait for explicit user approval ("yes", "approved", or "proceed")
      3. Only proceed with changes after receiving approval
      
      Your last proposal must be followed by user approval before any changes can be made.

      Best practices for proposing code modifications:
      
      1. Use the [PROPOSAL] template format
      2. List each file and specific changes clearly
      3. Explain the reasoning and impact
      4. Wait for explicit approval
      5. Make changes exactly as proposed
      6. Allow user to review the changes

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Making changes without proposal and approval
      AI: *makes direct changes*
      
      # Bad: Informal proposal
      AI: "Should I change this function?"
      User: "ok"
      
      # Good: Proper proposal and approval
