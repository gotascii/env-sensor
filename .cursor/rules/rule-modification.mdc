# Rules Edit Protection

This rule prevents direct editing of rule files and instead recommends generating the full content for copy/paste.

description: Prevents direct editing of rule files and recommends generating full content for copy/paste

filters:
  # Match any attempts to edit .mdc files in the .cursor/rules directory
  - type: file_path
    pattern: "\\.cursor/rules/.*\\.mdc$"
  # Match edit operations
  - type: intent
    pattern: "edit|modify|update|change"

  - type: block
    message: |
      Direct editing of rule files through Cursor's tools is not recommended as it may cause issues.
      
      Instead, please follow this process:
      
      1. Ask me to generate the complete updated content of the rule file
      2. I will provide the entire file content in a code block
      3. You can copy this content and paste it into the file manually
      
      This approach ensures proper formatting and prevents potential errors that can occur when editing rule files directly.

    message: |
      I notice you want to modify a rule file. Would you like me to:
      
      1. Generate the complete updated content for you to copy/paste
      2. Explain the changes I recommend making
      
      This approach is more reliable than direct editing for rule files.

examples:
  - input: |
      User: "Can you update the auto-commit-workflow rule?"
      
      # What should happen:
      AI: "I notice you want to modify a rule file. Let me generate the complete updated content for you to copy/paste."
      AI: *provides complete updated file content in a code block*
      User: *manually applies changes*
    output: "Rule file is updated correctly without direct editing"
